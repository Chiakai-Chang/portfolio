* ## [Fraud Alert Account Rapid Investigator](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/autoFindAccountTaker)
  * Traditional methods of investigating "fraudulent bank passbook retrievers" (individuals who acquire the bank passbooks of victims of fraud) often yield limited results due to time constraints. The delay between a victim mailing their bank passbook and reporting the fraud to the police can sometimes exceed the storage period for surveillance footage, making it impossible to retrieve crucial evidence.
  * To address this, I developed this software that accelerates the investigation process. As soon as a fraud alert is raised for a victim's account, the program automatically compiles the account holder's details and searches for their contact information. The gathered information allows law enforcement to proactively reach out to the victims, asking where they have sent their bank passbooks. This approach enables officers to swiftly take action, increasing the chances of retrieving relevant surveillance footage before it's too late.

* ## [165 Fraud Case Audit Assistant](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/check165case)
  * Given the multitude of details to be considered when dealing with fraud cases, there is an inevitable risk of oversights, even for seasoned case handlers. Traditionally, manual audits often resulted in inconvenient disruptions, such as waking up colleagues in the early morning to address issues found by the audit.
  * The "165 Fraud Case Audit Assistant" was developed to streamline this process. It allows officers to conduct preliminary reviews of their inputted data on the 165 form, ensuring conformity with the requirements of the National Police Agency. Case handlers can simply upload the PDF file of their completed form for an initial review by the program. It suggests necessary corrections and helps reduce data input errors to a minimum.
  * Moreover, this tool fosters consistency in terminology and data entry, which significantly benefits statistical analysis and data-driven insights in fraud case management.

* ## [Automatic Fraud Data Analyzer](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/CarHandDataManager)
  * This program is an essential tool for officers tasked with managing, processing, and analyzing significant volumes of fraud withdrawal data, a task regularly updated by the Criminal Investigation Bureau every Tuesday and Thursday.
  * Traditionally, officers had to spend late nights on manual data verification and complex calculations to track fraud withdrawal trends within their jurisdictions. This process was labor-intensive and time-consuming.
  * With this program, these challenges are substantially alleviated. It automatically calculates fraud withdrawal variations, creates concise summary reports that are automatically sent to the LINE group for informational purposes, and generates templates for required official documents. This automation significantly reduces the manual workload, thus freeing up officer time and making it more manageable for substitutes who may be unfamiliar with the complexities of the task.

## Diligently developed various helper programs (Ready to use in Colab, click on the program name to open)
* ## [Facebook Friends Organizer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JCgq0qmmsAtfuICuyk_CciQVjgSfKZ33?usp=sharing)
   * Please refer to the tutorial: [User Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KI8intBMvUYx2rTMgFi2utGGM6oxEH0i/view)
   * Organize a large amount of Facebook comments or likes information that was difficult to manually compile in the past, and use it for "intersection analysis" to catch key suspects.

* ## [Bulk JSON Format Consolidation Helper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w1ApO_p3zh38ocU6jW5di3LXfeQWA3t6?usp=sharing)
  * Most of today's web pages are based on MVC and other architectures. In addition to the displayed web pages, they also use ajax and other methods to access APIs to get data to update the display (mostly in JSON format).
  * Because the aforementioned JSON data is often "richer" than what can be seen on the web page, and the format is easier to organize, so having a helper that can help receive these Json and convert them into an easier-to-operate excel format is a great advantage.
  * This helper currently has two usage methods to adapt to different situations:
    * Method 1: Organize a large number of downloaded JSON files
    * Method 2: Copy and paste one piece at a time, immediately convert JSON data and then export

* ## [Visual Intelligence Network Relationship Helper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hVI20D5MchN6OuSI8OSC6MVYTDSJclg6?usp=sharing)
  * The currently available visualization analysis software includes: i2 analyst's notebook, KeyLines, etc., which are really very useful.
  * But there are the following problems:
    1. The price of i2 is... the threshold is too high.
    2. KeyLines needs to be used within the official system, and more attention needs to be paid to information security audit and other concerns.
  * Plus, sometimes I just want to "display" the relationship between intelligence, to help judge and analyze data.
  * So I wrote a small program so that everyone can visualize the relationship between their data at any time for free.

* ## [AWS IP Confirmation Helper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T7vX0L2gs9VCNzwzSpvsI84rGTFRXl3R?usp=sharing)
   * If you encounter an IP that is Amazon (Amazon), you can use this helper to confirm what cloud service the IP is for AWS.
      * You can also refer to the online query tool provided by RyanLabs: AWS IP Range Checker/Lookup Tool
         * This tool can only query IPv4 data
   * This program is downloaded from the official: AWS IP address ranges to compare the latest IP information (Json file, including IPv4 and IPv6), which is the most immediate and accurate data

* ## [Address to Latitude and Longitude Helper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BWleXRAN1vM82-k9lz-O78fPMqBZf581?usp=sharing)
  * Use the "National Land Surveying Cloud" electronic map of the Ministry of the Interior to query the complete administrative area (up to the village and neighborhood) and latitude and longitude of any address. 

* ## [User-Agent Parsing Helper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IP1t7yFuIYLnTttwcn_V5fy3XkJASk2d?usp=sharing)
  * When doing log analysis, you often encounter User-Agent data, which usually includes application type (browser), operating system, software vendor, etc., and sometimes includes software revision version information.
  * Because the string is not easy to read, a small program is specially used to help parse the key points.

* ## [Packet Headers Text to Dict Helper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15auzjfvWt6HICDyKtTDEFfKpoT-TlG7s?usp=sharing)
   * Use DevTools to find and copy the text content related to Requests Headers of the packet.
   * After pasting into the program, it can be organized into a convenient-to-use dict format, and the cookie is automatically separated.

* ## [Timestamp Conversion Helper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uzcBbl5EHOn8J5S_UHWQ2_rpfs_Gjttp?usp=sharing)
  * When doing data cleaning and data mining, you occasionally find time represented by numbers (i.e., timestamps).
  * Because although the timestamp is very convenient for comparing "date and time differences" and easy to do "timezone addition and subtraction calculations", it is not easy to intuitively understand what time it is, so a small helper is written for convenience.
  * This helper currently has two usage methods to adapt to different situations:
    * Method 1: Convert "timestamp" to "AD date"
    * Method 2: Convert "any date format" to "timestamp"

* ## [Text Encryption and Decryption Techniques](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lq6E8jFDKuXveji5zJmzl7m7hT3o3503?usp=sharing)
   * Provides 2 types of encryption and decryption related to text, especially "binary conversion" is often used by the information security community to hide speeches.
   * Includes:
      * Caesar encryption
      * Binary conversion (commonly used in the information security community)"
