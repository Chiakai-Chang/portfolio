  * A tool designed to analyze complex code during on-site software development investigations.
  * It uses AI to quickly analyze code, identify potential illegal activities, and extract key information.
  * [![](https://chiakai-chang.github.io/tempHTML/img/CFOS.jpg)](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/CodeForensicsOnScene)

* ## [IPwhois Good Search](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/CheckIP):
  * A program that automatically extracts and organizes IPs from large data sets, performs IP Whois queries, and compiles the results into an Excel spreadsheet.
  * It's particularly useful for Taiwanese IPs.
  * [![](https://chiakai-chang.github.io/tempHTML/img/IPwhoisTool.jpg)](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/CheckIP)

* ## [PTT_Crawler](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/PTT_Crawler_ByUser):
  * A tool developed for PTT, one of Taiwan's largest internet news platforms.
  * It saves basic information, related articles, comments, nicknames, and IP records used by the queried ID.
  * It also integrates online OSINT resources and automatically completes the IP whois query work.
  * [![](https://chiakai-chang.github.io/tempHTML/img/PTT_Crawler_ByUser.jpg)](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/PTT_Crawler_ByUser)

* ## [Taichung Surveillance Camera Filter & Downloader](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/AutoCamDownloader)
  * This project aims to resolve several issues encountered during the retrieval of surveillance footage, such as the requirement to install multiple web components for viewing or downloading footage, inability to quickly scroll through history, wasted time waiting for downloads, and manual location of cameras on GIS maps.
  * With this tool, you can select the location of an incident, specify the scope and time period for review, and automatically download surveillance footage on a large scale, easing the workload considerably.
  * [![](https://chiakai-chang.github.io/tempHTML/img/AutoCamDownloader.jpg)](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/AutoCamDownloader)

* ## [Fraud Alert Account Rapid Investigator](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/autoFindAccountTaker)
  * Traditional methods of investigating "fraudulent bank passbook retrievers" (individuals who acquire the bank passbooks of victims of fraud) often yield limited results due to time constraints. The delay between a victim mailing their bank passbook and reporting the fraud to the police can sometimes exceed the storage period for surveillance footage, making it impossible to retrieve crucial evidence.
  * To address this, I developed this software that accelerates the investigation process. As soon as a fraud alert is raised for a victim's account, the program automatically compiles the account holder's details and searches for their contact information. The gathered information allows law enforcement to proactively reach out to the victims, asking where they have sent their bank passbooks. This approach enables officers to swiftly take action, increasing the chances of retrieving relevant surveillance footage before it's too late.
  * [![](https://chiakai-chang.github.io/tempHTML/img/findAccTakenCase.jpg)](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/autoFindAccountTaker)

* ## [165 Fraud Case Audit Assistant](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/check165case)
  * Given the multitude of details to be considered when dealing with fraud cases, there is an inevitable risk of oversights, even for seasoned case handlers. Traditionally, manual audits often resulted in inconvenient disruptions, such as waking up colleagues in the early morning to address issues found by the audit.
  * The "165 Fraud Case Audit Assistant" was developed to streamline this process. It allows officers to conduct preliminary reviews of their inputted data on the 165 form, ensuring conformity with the requirements of the National Police Agency. Case handlers can simply upload the PDF file of their completed form for an initial review by the program. It suggests necessary corrections and helps reduce data input errors to a minimum.
  * Moreover, this tool fosters consistency in terminology and data entry, which significantly benefits statistical analysis and data-driven insights in fraud case management.
  * [![](https://chiakai-chang.github.io/tempHTML/img/check165case.jpg)](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/check165case)

* ## [Automatic Fraud Data Analyzer](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/CarHandDataManager)
  * This program is an essential tool for officers tasked with managing, processing, and analyzing significant volumes of fraud withdrawal data, a task regularly updated by the Criminal Investigation Bureau every Tuesday and Thursday.
  * Traditionally, officers had to spend late nights on manual data verification and complex calculations to track fraud withdrawal trends within their jurisdictions. This process was labor-intensive and time-consuming.
  * With this program, these challenges are substantially alleviated. It automatically calculates fraud withdrawal variations, creates concise summary reports that are automatically sent to the LINE group for informational purposes, and generates templates for required official documents. This automation significantly reduces the manual workload, thus freeing up officer time and making it more manageable for substitutes who may be unfamiliar with the complexities of the task.
  * [![](https://chiakai-chang.github.io/tempHTML/img/CarHandDataManager.jpg)](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/CarHandDataManager)

* ## [Good Search for Latitude/Longitude/Address](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/location_to_html):
  * A program that helps mark related latitudes and longitudes on the map, provide batch address to latitude and longitude functions, and produce portable map HTML files for information sharing and analysis.
  * It's especially useful for analyzing large amounts of data, such as surveillance locations, car travel records, IP communications, and addresses.
  * [![](https://chiakai-chang.github.io/tempHTML/img/location_to_html.jpg)](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/location_to_html)

## Various Helper Programs Developed with Care (For Specific Tasks)

* ## [All-Net/FB Group Forensic Key Information Reporting Bureau](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/FacebookCrawler)
  * During elections, major events, or security crises, teams often have to be mobilized to monitor the Internet and social media platforms around the clock, resulting in exhaustion.
  * Hence, this web crawler program was developed to automatically filter key information across the Internet during various elections or major events like the World Series. It has proven helpful in identifying election gambling or sensitive information, allowing teams to respond promptly.
  * [![](https://chiakai-chang.github.io/tempHTML/img/Crawler.jpg)](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/FacebookCrawler)

* ## [Automatic YouTube Ad Crawler](https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/AutoParseYoutubeAD)
  * In recent years, YouTube ads have been frequently misused by fraud groups, causing many people to fall for scams. However, collecting fraudulent ad reports has been an inefficient process, heavily relying on luck and algorithmic recommendations.
  * Therefore, this crawler program was developed to aid in searching for fraudulent ads using most likely keywords and minimizes the ad rotation time. It collects and organizes ad information as required for reporting. To date, this tool has successfully collected thousands of advertisements.

## Various Helper Programs Developed with Care  (Ready to use in Colab, click on the program name to open)
* ## [Facebook Friends Organizer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JCgq0qmmsAtfuICuyk_CciQVjgSfKZ33?usp=sharing)
   * Please refer to the tutorial: [User Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KI8intBMvUYx2rTMgFi2utGGM6oxEH0i/view)
   * Organize a large amount of Facebook comments or likes information that was difficult to manually compile in the past, and use it for "intersection analysis" to catch key suspects.

* ## [Bulk JSON Format Consolidation Helper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w1ApO_p3zh38ocU6jW5di3LXfeQWA3t6?usp=sharing)
  * Most of today's web pages are based on MVC and other architectures. In addition to the displayed web pages, they also use ajax and other methods to access APIs to get data to update the display (mostly in JSON format).
  * Because the aforementioned JSON data is often "richer" than what can be seen on the web page, and the format is easier to organize, so having a helper that can help receive these Json and convert them into an easier-to-operate excel format is a great advantage.
  * This helper currently has two usage methods to adapt to different situations:
    * Method 1: Organize a large number of downloaded JSON files
    * Method 2: Copy and paste one piece at a time, immediately convert JSON data and then export

* ## [Visual Intelligence Network Relationship Helper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hVI20D5MchN6OuSI8OSC6MVYTDSJclg6?usp=sharing)
  * The currently available visualization analysis software includes: i2 analyst's notebook, KeyLines, etc., which are really very useful.
  * But there are the following problems:
    1. The price of i2 is... the threshold is too high.
    2. KeyLines needs to be used within the official system, and more attention needs to be paid to information security audit and other concerns.
  * Plus, sometimes I just want to "display" the relationship between intelligence, to help judge and analyze data.
  * So I wrote a small program so that everyone can visualize the relationship between their data at any time for free.

* ## [AWS IP Confirmation Helper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T7vX0L2gs9VCNzwzSpvsI84rGTFRXl3R?usp=sharing)
   * If you encounter an IP that is Amazon (Amazon), you can use this helper to confirm what cloud service the IP is for AWS.
      * You can also refer to the online query tool provided by RyanLabs: AWS IP Range Checker/Lookup Tool
         * This tool can only query IPv4 data
   * This program is downloaded from the official: AWS IP address ranges to compare the latest IP information (Json file, including IPv4 and IPv6), which is the most immediate and accurate data

* ## [Address to Latitude and Longitude Helper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BWleXRAN1vM82-k9lz-O78fPMqBZf581?usp=sharing)
  * Use the "National Land Surveying Cloud" electronic map of the Ministry of the Interior to query the complete administrative area (up to the village and neighborhood) and latitude and longitude of any address. 

* ## [User-Agent Parsing Helper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IP1t7yFuIYLnTttwcn_V5fy3XkJASk2d?usp=sharing)
  * When doing log analysis, you often encounter User-Agent data, which usually includes application type (browser), operating system, software vendor, etc., and sometimes includes software revision version information.
  * Because the string is not easy to read, a small program is specially used to help parse the key points.

* ## [Packet Headers Text to Dict Helper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15auzjfvWt6HICDyKtTDEFfKpoT-TlG7s?usp=sharing)
   * Use DevTools to find and copy the text content related to Requests Headers of the packet.
   * After pasting into the program, it can be organized into a convenient-to-use dict format, and the cookie is automatically separated.

* ## [Timestamp Conversion Helper](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uzcBbl5EHOn8J5S_UHWQ2_rpfs_Gjttp?usp=sharing)
  * When doing data cleaning and data mining, you occasionally find time represented by numbers (i.e., timestamps).
  * Because although the timestamp is very convenient for comparing "date and time differences" and easy to do "timezone addition and subtraction calculations", it is not easy to intuitively understand what time it is, so a small helper is written for convenience.
  * This helper currently has two usage methods to adapt to different situations:
    * Method 1: Convert "timestamp" to "AD date"
    * Method 2: Convert "any date format" to "timestamp"

* ## [Text Encryption and Decryption Techniques](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lq6E8jFDKuXveji5zJmzl7m7hT3o3503?usp=sharing)
   * Provides 2 types of encryption and decryption related to text, especially "binary conversion" is often used by the information security community to hide speeches.
   * Includes:
      * Caesar encryption
      * Binary conversion (commonly used in the information security community)"
