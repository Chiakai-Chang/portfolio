# ★ First of its Kind - [AI Simulated Web Reconnaissance Game](https://poe.com/WebCopGame) ★
## Features:
* Learn about web reconnaissance techniques through an intriguing detective game.
* Employs the Claude Instant language model.
  * Outperforms ChatGPT in dialogue relevance, technical comprehension, and code generation.
  * Offers more user-friendly conversation techniques, making it easier to guide towards specific dialogue directions.
* Simply log in with a Google account for unlimited, free use.
* Web-based, compatible with PC, Android, and iOS.

## Design Principles:
* The game provides you with a progressive simulation case, allowing you to leverage web investigation techniques to understand the clues and plot.
* Throughout the game, I offer suggestions at different levels. Starting from simple recommendations/descriptions of web elements, I gradually guide you to use devtools for more detailed webpage investigations and JSON analysis.
* You will experience a real-life investigative process that requires a combination of web and real-world research, and we attempt to simulate many of the traps and difficulties you might encounter while investigating real cases.
* Most importantly, I hope that you learn many practical web investigation skills through this fun game, and these "simulated exercises" truly aid you in your work.
* Lastly, I must reiterate, the purpose of this "game" is solely to provide knowledge and discussion about web reconnaissance. It does not condone or teach any illegal or inappropriate behavior.

# ★ First-Person Simulation Training - Conducting Game Theoretic/Fraud Crime Scene Investigation ★
## Features:
* A first of its kind in Taiwan, "First-Person Perspective - Fraud Crime Scene Investigation Simulation Training" offers a unique and immersive training method, incorporating gaming elements and first-person perspective. Different from traditional training styles, this simulation allows users to learn while playing. Even for newcomers, this simulation provides hands-on experience in investigating crime scenes, finding clues, interrogating foreign-language suspects, reacting to live scenarios, and analyzing evidence. Most importantly, it is not limited to game theory/fraud cases and can be applied to different crime scenarios and roles to comprehensively train investigative skills and adaptive abilities, strengthening overall investigative capabilities.
* Additionally, the game can utilize the "AI Code Recognition Assistant," an AI-based tool designed to quickly identify suspicious programs. It is the first tool in the country that can tell you what a program does and what illegal activities it might be involved in, thus enhancing digital forensic capabilities at crime scenes.
